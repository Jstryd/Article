<h4> I Am My Today </h4>

<h6>August 29, 2014 </h6>


<p> I start my day with remembering my Dream. I am swiftly and surely converting it into a Vision. I see myself in the final Goal, arriving at my Creation. </p>

<p>In my journey toward understanding my beliefs,I sense an intruder saying you'll never make it. The odds are against me, and it begins to dictate evidence; Time is not there, resist sacrifice, and me is listening to me.</p>

<p>I demand you show yourself; "What are you called?"It responds: "It is me... FEAR; the instigator of me in me. I create lies in our path by questions of 'What if's?' I exist to affirm we will never have, or be what we want to be."</p>

<p>Suddenly, I AM awakened to who is in control. Why am I listening to this? I AM the creator of my destiny.</p>

<p>I will rename fear and now your inspiration. I AM embracing fear, and I will prove it wrong Through commitment and actions for me.</p>

<p>I AM strong in small steps, For my small steps will get me to the tops of the mountains.</p>

<p>I AM in control, Taking movements in contradiction of fear and recognize I AM above it.</p>

<p>I no longer entertain "Who Am I" but I know "Who I AM". I AM in control. </p>
